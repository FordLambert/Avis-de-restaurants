This is the seventh project of my path with OpenClassroom.

The point here, is to learn about API by practicing on a restaurants recommendations application.

They must have the following functionalities :

    A map with Google Map API
    A list of restaurant with comments and stars (from 1 to 5)
    An automatic position of the map with Js position API
    Option to add comments and restaurant to the list to make them appear on the map
